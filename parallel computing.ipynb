    "\n",
    "In __sequential__ computing (or __serial__ computing), programs are computed in sequential order one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In __parallel computing__, different programs are computed on different processor at the same time. This is a faster option. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having double processors doesn't mean the speed will be double as well. In case of multi processing, the processors need to communicate with each other to coordinate their actions. Because one processor might need the calculation output of other processor.\n",

    "### Process vs. Thread\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "A __process__ is an independent instance of a running program. Processes are independent of each other and hence don't share a memory or other resources. They include code, data, and state information. \n",
    "Note: You can checkout the number of processors in \"task manager\" (in performance tab). Furthermore, you can monitor the performance of each process in \"resource monitor\".\n",

    "    - If we want heavy-weight.\n",
    "\n",
