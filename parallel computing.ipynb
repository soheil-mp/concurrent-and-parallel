    "In __sequential__ computing (or __serial__ computing), programs are computed in sequential order one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In __parallel computing__, different programs are computed on different processor at the same time. This is a faster option. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having double processors doesn't mean the speed will be double as well. In case of multi processing, the processors need to communicate with each other to coordinate their actions. Because one processor might need the calculation output of other processor.\n",
